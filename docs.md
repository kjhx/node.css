# Documentation

Being a Jekyll theme, node.css has support for a wide range of Markdown elements. Nearly all of them (at least, the commonplace ones) have been styled in accordance with a common look & feel, a theme inspired by the one and only [@N-O-D-E](https://github.com/N-O-D-E). Let's take a look at some of the internals and features of node.css:

## Layout

This theme is built on a flexbox-based extensible grid system, similar to that used by [francisco](https://francisco.huggins.io). This allows for incredibly flexible layouts when required. Here's a quick demo of our columns:

## Headers

The `post` layout will automatically place the post title as an H1 tag, so in posts you can simply begin your post without introduction. The `core` layout does no such pre-formatting, allowing you to start the page as you wish. This is what our styled headers looks like:

>
# Header 1
## Header 2
>

You often don't need any more headers than just those two. Notice that H1 is underlined, so it's recommended that you only use it as a title or similar element.
